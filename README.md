# Personal Portfolio

Hey! This is my personal Portfolio's repository. I made the website using HTML, CSS (lot's of flexbox) and JavaScript.


## Features

- Designed and developed exclusively by me using Figma and VSCode
- Fully responsive from desktop to mobile.
- Frequently updated tech stack section depending on what I'm working on.



## Roadmap

- Dark mode switch
